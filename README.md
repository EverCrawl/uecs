**Î¼ECS** is an ECS library.

With the ECS paradigm, you can decouple your game's state from its logic, among other benefits,
such as *extremely* fast performance. Most games, from ones built in the Unity or Unreal engines, all the way
to custom-engine AAA titles, utilize some variation of the ECS paradigm.

This library's main goals are to be lightweight and user-friendly, but most importantly, to be fast.
