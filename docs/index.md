It's hard to say what the proper usage should be, because this library is so flexible! Nevertheless, here are some examples to help inspire you:

* [simple-ai](./simple-ai), which contains:
  * An AI system
    * Entities walk or stand around aimlessly on the canvas
  * A collision detection + response system
    * You can't walk beyond the screen dimensions
  * Example rendering system using the Canvas2D API
    * The player is drawn as a square
    * The other entities are drawn as circles
